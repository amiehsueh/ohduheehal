                            <p>So I got this computer used about 4 months ago, and it had been upgraded from windows 8.1 to 10. I haven't had a problem with it since I bought it, I love this computer. Now suddenly it's saying that windows isn't activated and every time I try activating it, it says that it can't connect to my organization's activation server. I know I haven't connected this computer to any "organization" or anything so I really don't know what to do. I would ask the guy I bought it from but I have since Hi everyone, I am looking for some advice. I bought a Wintel mini-pc for my brother from geekbuying earlier this year (Feb). For reference here is the link: It was advertised as having windows 10 loaded onto it and I checked when it arrived and windows was genuinely activated. Fast forward a few months later and he tells me that a popup is telling him to activate. So my pc was literally spamming me with "your windows license will expire soon" for a whole 5 minutes or so every time I launch the pc or connect to the internet, so I looked it up online and one site said to use some command in cmd to rearm it and i didnt know what that meant so i followed it yeah, my windows 10 isn't activated now. I got bamboozled. I have since tried to pirate the license for 3 days, no luck. What I've done so far is: 1. disabled anti-virus before doing. # EDIT: As far as I can tell, my issue is resolved. For those who are stumbling across this and having troubles with MSTK, see my standalone comment below. amp#x200B; I was wondering if anybody else is having/had troubles using MSTK v2.6.4 to activate Windows 10 (Home or Pro). My friend contacted me a couple of days ago asking for help, and it turns out that AutoKMS (which I installed about a year ago and was working perfectly fine beforehand) randomly failed out of the blue. He was constan. 
For some reason, I have Windows 10 Pro installed but I have a key for windows 10 home. Literally everything I've tried isn't working and I even called them to no avail. I tried using the media creation tool, looked up shady shit to download and try to remove it, but nothing is doing anything. At this point I have no idea what to do. Any other ideas? Edit: Error code - 0xC004F074. Hi- I'm starting to put together a reference Windows 10 1809 image for our deployment processes. I have the KMS server defined, but when I run "slmgr.vbs /ato" I get error 0xC004F074 " The Software Licensing Service reported that the product could not be activated. No Key Management Service (KMS) could be contacted" When I look at the event logs, the request was sent and there's no reference to the error. I've verified there are no firewall issues and an 1803 machine can activate Hi All, Relatively new to Azure, I didn't build the environment, (I work within Server Support). Issue is with a couple of boxes , Server 2016 Datacenter Edition Noticed some pop-ups that the license expires in 20 days, Have followed this document https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/mast/2017/06/14/troubleshooting-windows-activation-failures-on-azure-vms/ PS C:\Source\PSTools (1)gt \psping.exe kms.core.windows.net:1688 PsPing v2.10 - PsPing - ping, latency, bandwidth measurement utility. Title is long but says it all. I have my product key on hand but I can't change it or activate Windows 10 Enterprise with it again because there is no organization for me to contact, this is a personal home computer connected to my personal Wi-Fi. A tech shop set Windows back up for me after a SSD crash a few months ago and I had no idea that it being Windows 10 Enterprise would affect anything. I have already tried reactivating, getting a new product key, updating Windows and rebooting. It's my first post! I have been using Windows 10 from my school, and now I graduated, and the service expired (apparently we were getting renewals every 180 days from school). Now when I try to get a key or something from other Windows 10 version so that Microsoft is able to downgrade my version, but returns to me with an error code 0xc004f074 but I tried different methods and would not work. Some videos I watched on youtube suggested to use Media creation took thingy and change the Windows. Okay, so yeah I know, naughty naughty and whatever. But I am a changed man now! I have paid for a windows 10 key. However, because I didn't set up the crack (I know hardly anything about how it even works), I don't actually know if when I type this product key in it will work because on the activation page in the settings it says a load of stuff about not being able to connect to the activation server (guessing that's the crack's job?) and I'm getting the error code 0xC004F074 Edit: First Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Enterprise LTSB 2016 fixed the issue. After update was applied, KMS activation worked fine with "Windows Srv 2016 DataCtr/Std KMS" key. I seem to be having a huge issue trying to get Windows 10 LTSB 2016 OSes to activate through KMS. I've tried to add multiple combinations of keys to my KMS server but without much luck. Currently for Windows 10 Enterprise 1607 CBB I am using my "Windows Srv 2012R2 DataCtr/Std KMS for Windows 10" which seems. So we have a KMS server running Server 2008 R2 and have configured it to activate Office 2013 however our clients are saying the following: Error 0xC004F074 The Office client was unable to reach a KMS host server for activation. The server looks okay and the SRV records exist. Anyone had any issues with this? Additional Info: Clients can ping and reverse lookup the KMS server. The clients are running Windows 10. There is already an Office 2010 KMS key on the server. The clients. 
So i've been using my windows 10 for about 2 years now and everything was fine until a few days ago I had a watermark telling me to activate windows. But I couldn't because now I got this 0xC004F074 error. Anyway Has anyone else had issues with getting KMS to activate Windows 10 2016 LTSB machines? I recently installed our latest Windows Server 2016 DataCtr/Std KMS key on our KMS host which has Server 2012 R2 as the OS. I activated it, but clients with the latest Windows 10 LTSB image on them throw error 0xC004F074 when our desktop team tries to activate them. I've installed the updates needed to support the new KMS keys on a Server If some of you were following my previous post here: (which you all downvoted to oblivion?) you'll know that I was trying to set up a Office 2013 KMS host on Server 2008, which is not possible. I finally relented and installed the KMS Host on Windows 7 (my workstation). I've got 6 machines going with Office 2013 right now, 5 are activated fine. The problem is, my copy of Office 2013 will not activate. The upgrade through Windows update went well but now I'm getting errors saying windows cannot activate with error code: 0xC004F074 Any ideas? EDIT: Found a solution to the issue here: http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_install/product-keys-for-windows-10-insider-preview-build/8596c6dc-bdb4-4e33-b6eb-bc02e8f165c1. Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-5500U CPU @ 2.40GHz 2.40 GHz Installed memory (RAM): 8.00 GB System type: 64-bit Operating System, x64-based processor Acer Laptop I upgraded my OS to windows 10 home last year and never had activation issues. Recently, I tried getting a copy of microsoft office through "other means" which required another program (its name was KMSauto or something like that) to provide microsoft office activation every now and then. Soon after I decided to uninstall
